üí´ About Me:

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm an AI engineer with a strong background in machine learning and deep learning, specializing in computer vision. I have a passion for discovering the Foundation behind any concept in the field and i'm actively seeking opportunities to work on real-world Projects 

üíº  I've spent nearly 2 years working on real-world projects in computer vision. using Frameworks like Tensorflow and Pytorch ,creating and using machine learning models for tasks like Objects Detection , image segmentation, and image classification tasks

üî¨ I possess a deep understanding of both classical computer vision methods and contemporary deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. I am skilled in working with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

üåü  I work well in teams and I have worked In collaborative environments to eliver end-to-end AI solutions.I'm also experienced in preprocessing and augmenting large-scale image datasets, training deep learning models, and optimizing their performance for production deployment.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to see some of my work and projects and i'm also expert at kaggle so you can see my work there too.

üì´ You can reach me at mostafamenna304@gmail.com or connect with me on [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-%230077B5.svg?logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/menna-mostafa-1ab0311b7/)  to discuss collaborations, opportunities, or simply to chat about AI and computer vision.

Looking forward to connecting with fellow AI enthusiasts and collaborating on exciting projects!
